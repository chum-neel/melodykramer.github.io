Today I walked to my friend Betty&#8217;s apartment to drop off some spaghetti and meatballs. Betty is 89 and lives just up the street. She doesn&#8217;t drive much anymore, though she still volunteers (at the White House, of all places.)

After we drank tea, I watched Betty read articles on her iPad. Her Internet was really slow. She kept accidentally clicking on the ads, or on parts of the story that she didn&#8217;t mean to click on. And she was getting a bit frustrated and worried &#8212; that by clicking on something, she was going to install malware or not be able to return to her story.

There are 13 million people between the ages of 75 and 84 in the US. There are 5 million between the ages of 85 and 94. ([census][1]) That population will grow. At some point, it will be composed of digital natives but that&#8217;s a while away. In the interim, are there better ways to design websites for this population? Are there better ways to design the news for them? Of course.

Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m picturing:

1. a site with simple resizable text + photos with links clearly differentiated in some way (maybe links are at the bottom or in a clearly delineated box)  
2. or a site with text and photos and no links  
3. no pop-ups, no overlaid ads, no bait-and-switch links  
4. easy and big scroll buttons  
5. maybe two-steps needed to leave the page

From an overall design process strong consideration needs to be given to the functional reason as to why someone who didn't grow up with with technology would decide to use it. It could be as simple as a need to communicate with your grandchildren who live far away, or it could be as complex as finding ways to retain your independence and being self-sufficient after moving into a retirement residence. This question needs to be asked before venturing down the design-path, with the question "how much closer does this service get the user to fulfilling their need". 

Have you seen something that would be well-designed for Betty? What would you make?   #newsforbetty
